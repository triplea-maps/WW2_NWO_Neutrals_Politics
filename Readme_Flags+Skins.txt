Hints for customization:

1) Alternative relief tiles are available for 1-click installation (similar to map installation) in the repository. After being downloaded, they can easily be selected from the menu "View" under "Map Skins" from within TripleA, once the normal map is loaded.

2) An alternative flag set also exists. It is already included with the version. To activate it, the current "flags" folder of NWO has to be renamed into something different, and the folder "flags_alternative" needs to become "flags".
